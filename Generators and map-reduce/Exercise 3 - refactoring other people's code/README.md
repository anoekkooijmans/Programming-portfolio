## Step 4: Come up with enhancements

The code could be improved in a few ways. Firstly, the part that gathers information from web pages is trying to do too many things at once. It would be better to split it into smaller parts, each focusing on just one task. Secondly, if we want to add more features later, it should be easy to do so without having to change too much of the existing code. Thirdly, if we create another class that does similar things to this one, it should be simple to use it instead without causing any issues. Lastly, if someone only needs to use a small part of this class, they shouldn't be forced to deal with all the other parts they don't need. Making these adjustments will keep the code organized, flexible, and easier to understand and work with in the future.
