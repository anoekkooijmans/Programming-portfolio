## Do you see possibilities with this architecture within your own projects? How would you seperate the production of data from the consummation of it?

Integrating this structure into my current internship project, where I'm building a tool to test different statistical methods for analyzing RNA-seq data, would make the code organized and easier to work with. By using this design, I can keep data processing and statistical analysis separate, which helps make the code clearer and simpler to update. I can create classes for different statistical methods, like correlation calculations or network-based analysis, and plug them into the code easily. With a clear structure in place, it's straightforward to try out new statistical techniques and see how well they work for our RNA-seq analysis.
