**Does the code adhere to SOLID principles?**

While the code mostly adheres to the SOLID principles, some improvements could be made in the single responsibility principle by furthering splitting up methods. For instance, the `add_molecule` and `photosynthesis`could be split up into separate classes. This would ensure that the class only has one responsibility, instead of the multiple responsibilities it has now.

Certain hardcoded elements such as "water" and "co2" could be changed into constants so that these can be changed more easily. This would also make it more open for extension.
